## Static - Webpage
This homework required us to reproduce the provided page as closely as possible. We were not allowed to use any frameworks and required us to do it with **HTML, CSS** (and like the professor said, code as if you are in 1995).

## Airline - JSON
This homework consisted of writing a **HTML/Javascript** program that takes a JSON URL as input which contains Airline Information, the program then parses the **JSON** file and extracts the list of Airlines, and displays them in a formatted table. All of the parsing and formatting is done with the help of Javascript that is embedded in HTML. It can be executed in any browser. It also handles the various error cases that can be present in a JSON.

## Stock - PHP
This homework required us to use **PHP and Javascript** and create a webpage that allows us to search for stock information using the Stock quote API, and the results will be displayed in both tabular format and charts format using **HighCharts**.The page also provides News clips for the selected stock.  

## Stock-Bootstrap-NodeJS-AngularJS
This homework required the use of **Node.js, AngularJS, Amazon Web Services, FB API (Feed), Bootstrap, JQuery, JSON, HTML5**  to build a webpage that displays stock information, chart data, historical charts and news for a selected stock. It involved the usage of MarkitOnDemand API for Autocompletion, AlphaVantage API for getting stock, indicator for a stock data in JSON format. Highcharts to generate charts for indicators and historical data. Also, the highcharts export API was used to generate image urls, which can then be used to share the images to the Facebook Feed of the user. The Seeking Alpha news API was used for news section of the app.We also made use of the HTML5 local storage to store stock favourites, implement auto refresh and forced refresh functions for these saved stocks. 
This homework required us to make a Responsive Web Site (Using Bootstrap) that would automatically scale with the devices (Desktop, Mobile, Tablet).

## Stock- iOS app
This homework required us to use **iOS** to replicate the functionality of Homework - 8 in a mobile app. We were given the choice of an Android or an iOS app. I replicated the functionality in an iOS app.
