# Description
We were are required to write a HTML/JavaScript program, which takes the URL of a JSON document containing US Airlines information, parses the JSON file, and extracts the list of airlines, displaying them in a table. The JavaScript program will be embedded in an HTML file so that it can be executed within a browser.<br>

• The program displayed a text box to enter the JSON file name as shown below and on clicking the “Submit Query” button, the program displayed the table as shown below. If the text box is left empty and Submit Query is clicked, an appropriate
error message was shown.<br>

• Once the JSON file is downloaded, a JavaScript function within the
HTML file parses the JSON document that was passed as an input to
the popped up window.<br>
• After parsing the JSON document, a table should be displayed
consisting of the data for all Airline companies that are contained in
the JSON file. For example, given the following XML document:<br>
[Airline JSON File](airline.json)<br>
